PiCoolFan Manager is a daemon studied for the PiCoolFan shield of
RaspberryPi. It monitors internal CPU temperature and set fan speed
accordingly.
This daemon works well with ArchLinux distribution, but should be fine
also for other Linux distributions that have systemd.

There is a script in this package that loads proper modules just before
the daemon starts. Moreover it sets the virtual RTC of the PiCoolFan as
system clock. In this way one can check hardware clock with "hwclock"
command. This can be useful if there's no internet connection and
ntp synchronization cannot be done.

--Prerequisites

Before using this you must install i2c tools, because it requires
"i2cset" command to operate. On ArchLinux you can install them with:
	~# pacman -S i2c-tools

Python 3 is also required. On ArchLinux install it with:
	~# pacman -S python
